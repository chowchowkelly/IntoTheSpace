# IntoTheSpace

This is an example of how to record player emotions in a Unity game using Affectiva's asset.  This is written on top of Into The Space which was written by Bug Games.  You can get the original on the Unity asset store:
https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/20749

When run, emotion metrics are filed to [yyyyMMdd_HHmmss]PlayerMetrics.csv in the project's root file (where yyyyMMdd_HHmmss is replaced with the date and time the game began).

# Setup project in Unity
git clone https://www.github.com/Affectiva/UnityChan.git 
Open the cloned repository in unity. File -> Open Scenes -> ActionCheck . Import the Affdex asset (download it from the getting started section of the [developer portal](http://developer.affectiva.com/unity/)).
